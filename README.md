# food-shelf
Science Fair Project 2021

In this project I'm building an app with which you can take a picture of food (leftovers or a meal). The app uses an image classification machine learning model to determine what food it is and it tells you how long the food can be stored (shelf life). This is a beginner project and my first time using Swift/SwiftUI. I hope you enjoy!
